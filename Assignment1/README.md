Project Title: Sex differences in calcium acivity of oxytocin neurons and neighbouring astrocytes in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus during social and stress stimuli.

Abstract: Oxytocin (OT) neurons within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), are known to be strongly activated by social stimuli and serve as anxiolytic facilitators during stress. Whether PVN OT neuronal responses to social and stress stimuli vary by sex remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, it remains unknown how these stimuli affect the activity of neighboring astrocytes, a major regulator of OT neuronal activity. To record in vivo population activity of OT neurons and neighboring astrocytes, we expressed genetically encoded calcium (Ca) reporters in OT neurons (RCaMP2) and astrocytes (GCaMP6f) and performed dual-channel fiber photometry. During these recordings, freely behaving male and female adult mice (n=10) underwent reciprocal social interaction test (familiar or unfamiliar conspecifics) and looming shadow stress test.

Data details: Data file includes peak Z-score value for each mouse (for mutual interaction). Sex (males, females).

Question: Is there a statistical sex difference in Max z-score OT Ca signal?

Statistical test: T-test
