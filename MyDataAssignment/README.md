My data assignment (in progress)

  Step 1: Calculate the average for each column from -10 to -5 seconds => baseline correction
  Step 2: Deduct the baseline correction value to each value in a column, and for each column. => data corrected
  Step 3: Only select the 1st 5 activities for each mouse
  Step 4: Identify the type of sniff for each activity

  The csv file "SocialPhotometryData_RCAMP" contains the Raw data of experimental mice F69, H25, H28, H82.
  The 1st column is time(s) from -10 to 10 seconds.
  Each column depicts 1 sniff interaction from the experimental mouse to the stimulus mouse.
